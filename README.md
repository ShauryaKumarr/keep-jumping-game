Game Idea: The Apple Collector

Description: The Apple Collector is a game where a user controls a character, and the objective 
involves collecting as much apples as possible without hitting the bombs. As the game progresses,
the game becomes more and more challenging, with the bombs size increasing as the score increases. However, 
there are also both debuffs and buffs, that can help you or end up finishing you. The goal is 
to get the highest score possible!

<u>Phase 1</u>
- [X] Create a character 
- [X] Create proper movements (left, right, up, down)
- [X] Create movement boundaries (character that goes off 
   the screen to the right will enter the left, vice-versa)

<u>Phase 2</u>
- [X] Create an apple object
- [X] Create a bomb object
- [X] Create proper drop rates for both objects
- [X] Add collision between the character and apple, which 
results in a score increase and the apple to disappear
- [X] Add collision between character and bomb, which results 
in the game being over.
- [X] Add scaling as score increases, to make the game more difficult
  (i.e bombs getting bigger after a certain score)
- [X] Create scoreboard

<u>Phase 3</u>
- [ ] Add different power ups, such as the character becoming faster 
or bombs returning to original size
- [ ] Make the game progressively difficult with bombs possibly having 
different attributes such as being able to follow you as a character
- [ ] Add effects when bomb or apple is collided with
- [ ] Make game more aesthetic, possibly have different backgrounds
- [ ] Make movement more efficient, and update theme if needed.
