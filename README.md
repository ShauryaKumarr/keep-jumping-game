Game Idea: Keep Jumping 

Description: Keep Jumping is a game heavily based off the
popular mobile game, Doodle Jump. Within this game, the player will
continue to jump onto platforms that fall from the sky, and 
if the player icon hits the ground, the game will eventually
end. If the player does not hit the ground, however, as time
goes by, the platforms will continue to fall faster and faster
to make the challenge of keeping up increasingly harder. Score
will be calculated until the very end, and the goal is to achieve
the highest score. 

<u>Phase 1</u>
- [X] Create a character 
- [X] Create proper movements (left, right, jump up)
- [X] Create movement boundaries (character that goes off 
   the screen to the right will enter the left, vice-versa)

<u>Phase 2</u>
- [ ] Code and enact gravity on character
- [ ] Create platforms that fall one by one randomly
- [ ] Create boundaries for the platforms
- [ ] Add collision between the character and platform

<u>Phase 3</u>
- [ ] Make the game end when character hits ground
- [ ] Make the platforms progressively fall faster 
- [ ] Add a score in the form of time alive
- [ ] Make any final adjustments 
- [ ] Add a background or other aesthetics if time available
